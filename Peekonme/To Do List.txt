Bug:

-	Deactiviate account cannot delete when the account has entries in other 		table. Due to how the DB is setup i guess

Functionality:

-	Buy Button
-	Set Stocks to SUM for calcaluation
-	My Listed Item Tab: need to rework to display something else
- 	Edit Tab: need to rework to display perhaps the game and stock the seller 		is selling
-	Upload Tab: MIGHT need to rework also. Depend on what information we want 		user to input for their game
-	Settings Tab: Need to thing what other function to put in. 
-	Deactivate account has no confirmation once click
-	Game Review Information
-	Seller Review Information

Nice to have but not important:

-	Change index.php background image to something that suit the theme
-	Change signup.php picture and word to suit the theme
-	Login and forgetPassword to change the image to suit the theme
