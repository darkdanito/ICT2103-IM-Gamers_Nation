During combat, the player character will engage in close-up melee battles against an assortment of mutant and cybernetic enemies and creatures, using a combo of punches, kicks and attacks with cybernetic weapon attachments such as a two-bladed chainsaw or laser blades. The game is rated M18 for violence and strong coarse language. Blood splattering occurs frequently during combat, where many mutant enemies will spew unrealistic-looking blue-coloured blood when attacked. Enemies can be dismembered into half with certain heavy attacks that the player character executes, but the gore parts are un-detailed and do not depict innards, flesh or bone. Blood stains and body parts will disappear from the environment after a few seconds. The guidelines at M18 state that “Realistic violence such as killing, maiming or causing serious injury to humanoid characters can be allowed if not sadistic, cruel and abhorrent”. Strong coarse language such as ‘motherf**ker’ and ‘f**k’ can be frequently heard during gameplay and in cinematic scenes. “Frequent use of strong coarse language” is allowed under the M18 guidelines for language."
